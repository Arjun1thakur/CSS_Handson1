        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML element are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><span class="strike bold">Css is not neccesary </span><span class="highlighter bold">CSS saves a lot of work</span>, it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li class="italic underline">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>

    <h2 class="red">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways: </h2>
    <ul class="letter_spacing">
        <li style="color: brown;">lnline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>      <!--Inline style-->
        <li id="internal_css">lnternal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li class="brown">External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li class="brown">The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="bold highlighter"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="brown">when comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is the CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to an element and it's used by javaScript.</p>
    <p class="brown">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p class="brown">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
